# LiteChat
An Instant Messenger for Web Applications - for those who spend more time on their laptops than their phones!

The web-app has been made using the following technologies:
  - <b>Backend</b> : Node.JS and Express
  - <b>Frontend</b> : HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery
  - <b>Database</b> : MongoDB
  
The application includes the following features :
  1. User registration and login through e-mail and through Google OAuth2 Authentication
  2. Dedicated chat-rooms for each peer-to-peer chat
  3. Delivered and Seen status on sent messages
  4. Ability to start a chat with a new user by entering just the email of the recipient
  5. Active status of the recipient
  6. All active chats appear in an easy-to-use side-menu
  
 The following features are aimed to be added in the future in decreasing order of priority:
  - End-to-End Encryption of chats by using assymetric key cryptography and de-serialization of chats from the database (for memory optimization)
  - Alert on new messages in case the user is not on the same browser tab as the application
  - Typing status whenever the other user is typing in the message box
  - UI/UX improvisation
  - Ability to send images and files in a data-optimized method
 

I would love Constructive Feedback, Possible bugs and Suggested Improvements on this application. Feel free to create an issue in the issues section for the same!
